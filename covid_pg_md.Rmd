## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(writexl)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)

```

```{r}
data <- read_csv('cases_by_county.csv')
data <-
  data%>%
drop_na(drop)o

```

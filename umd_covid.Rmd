## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(writexl)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(writexl)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)

```
```{r}
data <- read_csv('historic_covid.csv') 

list_data <- as.list(data$role)

data_pivot <- data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = role, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)

```
